Today I got a call from Adam Mahler. I think Adam has such an important posture in his business and it's one that I think is a part of the common good. I always love hearing about how Adam works with wine makers and consumer and everyone who has worked with him finds the humanity he puts into his work quite refreshing. Whether its googling his TEDx Toledo talk from a few years ago, or signing up for the next event he is apart of... I hope you get to know him and his work.
