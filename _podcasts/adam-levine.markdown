Today I got a call from Adam Levine. Adam is the Associate Director at the Toledo Museum of Art. When I wanted to dive in to the role our Museum plays in propelling the common good, I knew I had to start with Adam. And, if I can be honest, recording this episode reminded me why I love this podcast. Adam's take on art & empathy is something that will stick with me for sometime. So, I am really glad I recorded it and can share it here.
