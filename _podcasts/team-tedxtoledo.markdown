This week I got a call from... TEDx Toledo! So, TEDx Toledo can't technically call me but this episode is pretty close. My good friends Will Lucas and Molly Luetke stopped by the podcast to help me preview this year's TEDx Toledo. I have enjoyed organizing this event with Will and Molly for the past few years and as I thought about this year, I realized that 3 of our speakers this year have already been guests on the podcast! So, I decided to give a little preview of this year's event. Amelia, Scott and Adam's TEDx talks will certainly be different from these conversations, but this is a great primer for Thursday.

And, of course there is still time. Get your tickets at [www.tedxtoledo.com](www.tedxtoledo.com)
