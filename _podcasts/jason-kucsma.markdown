Today I got a call from Jason Kucsma. When you think about public institutions that exist for the common good, you can't get very far without mentioning the library. However, in an early conversation I had with Jason, I was really impressed by the ability of a long-standing organization like the library to evolve. In this episode Jason breaks this down for us and we also get a glimpse into his background and what connections he has made along the way.
