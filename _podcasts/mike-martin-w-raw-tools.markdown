Today, I got a call from Mike Martin with RAW Tools. Mike Martin will be with us at our Guns to Gardens event on October 29th and will take center stage when he transforms a gun taken out of our community into a garden tool that will be given to a community garden. I am so excited for this event and am even more so now after talking with Mike. He brings such a wise and a profound perspective to his work as well as to the issues of gun violence in our country. I hope you can join us for this event in a few short weeks.
