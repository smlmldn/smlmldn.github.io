Today, I finally get around to sharing a few post-election thoughts. I've been collecting thoughts and ideas and questions as they landed from time to time over the past several days. Rather than share that longer list, I chose 3 simple ideas that I think sum up all of the others. The long list can be sorted into these three buckets in a way. 

First I have a question about wisdom. Where do we get it? Who is going to offer it? Will we recognize it?

Then I wanted to talk about learning, acting and the relationship between the two. What is the deep learning we need to be attentive to in all of this? What action do we need to take? What is the importance of learning as much as we can before acting? And what are some of the reasons action is such a reflexive impulse? 

Wisdom. Learning + Acting. That's it. 

I'd love to hear your thoughts.
