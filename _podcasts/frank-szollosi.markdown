Today I got a call from Frank Szollosi. Frank, an environmental organizer who works for the National Wildlife Federation, has served on City Council and was a perfect candidate to close out our water series. In this episode, Frank helps us understand more about the political facets to this problem as well as how we can use our unique political geography to voice our concerns. At the end of the episode we spent some time talking about how a group, never one individual, is necessary to move forward the common good.
