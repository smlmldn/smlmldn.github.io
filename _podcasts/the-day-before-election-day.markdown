Today, I take a look back on the past year. As we sit the day before election day... lets reflect. What did we learn? What have we seen that will impact what we see moving forward? I offer a few observations and hope you have some space to think back over the past year for yourself. 

Then on Election Day and the Day After Election day I will be back with new episodes as well!
