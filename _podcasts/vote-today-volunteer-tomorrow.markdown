Today is the day! While early vote numbers are up almost everywhere, today is still the day that most of America votes for who they believe will lead out country for the next 4 years. 

And on the Election Day episode of A Call From... podcast I talk about the nature of voting. What is a vote? Why do we vote? And most of all, when do we vote? How do we continue in this act of voting even after the election is over? 

Tomorrow, I'll be back with part three of this series, talking about what I hope for as we move forward together.
