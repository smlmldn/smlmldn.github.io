Today I got a call from... Kurt Bench. Kurt is a vegetable farmer. He is a staple at your local farmer's market and is often wearing his "Who's your farmer" shirt. I find his story to be fascinating and his work to be admirable. I love hearing about his family and the incredible risk they took to give the Toledo region the gift of Shared Legacy. 

*New to the podcast this week! Make sure to listen all the way through to the end too. I am going to be sharing a few things from my work in the community at the end of each episode, as well as asking a question to think about or even offer a few thoughts on how today's topic connects to our city and how you can be involved. The common good is definitely a group project so I thought the podcast should reflect that.*
