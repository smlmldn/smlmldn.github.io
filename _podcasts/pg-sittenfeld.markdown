Today I got a call from P.G. Sittenfeld. P.G. is a Cincinnati City Councilman and recently ran for the US Senate. It was in this recent primary race that so many people were able to connect with P.G. and hear about his take on the issues that matter. One of those issues was common sense gun reform. In my opinion, P.G. tackled this issue with bravery. This is one of the reasons I found his candidacy so compelling. So many people talk about the need for fresh faces to inhabit our public offices. Well, P.G. is clearly up to the task and will be working at this for a long time. It was important for me to have him on this podcast, even though he isn't working day in and day out on Toledo's common good, because when a candidate in our state stands up for issues the way he has... we all benefit. And, we are all reminded of the work yet to be done.
