With only two weeks between now & election day, I wanted to talk to a few local candidates about what this campaign season has been like. You've heard the saying "all politics are local?" I believe that. On a future podcast I plan on talking about that very idea, but this week I wanted to get behind the campaign scenes a bit with Pete Gerken and Lindsay Navarre. [Pete](http://electpetegerken.com/) & [Lindsay](http://www.navarreforjudge.com/) have run really great campaigns so far and if you haven't heard their story I encourage you to dig a bit. Check out their websites or look up recent stories about their campaigns.

And, of course, I had to remind everyone about [Guns to Gardens](https://www.facebook.com/events/296740490686402/), happening this Saturday! If you can come, I would love to see you there!
