While working as the Executive Assistant to County Commissioner Pete Gerken, Brittany began learning about diversity and inclusion issues in our region. And I am convinced her work with Welcome Toledo Lucas County is some of the most important work in our area. I can not think of a project more central to our work of creating an inclusive community where we honor all forms of the human expression than this initiative. Yet, this work has been met with some solid resistance. I am so glad Brittany decided to have this conversation because I want everyone, everywhere to learn more about the work of Welcome TLC, but more importantly, we all need to hear about the heart behind the work. Brittany knows how to take us there and make the case for the type of community we should strive to become.
