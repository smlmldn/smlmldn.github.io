So, I was driving home today, still thinking about the Guns to Gardens event from Saturday, and I wanted to share a few with you. Thoughts and questions and moments of self-doubt and wonder at how things come to be and how certain things never seem to change and how we need to keep on pushing forward anyway. You know, some deep stuff.  (Also, I'm in my car, so there is a bit of car noise. Sorry about that.) 

*Next week: 3 days in a row on the election and politics and a few notes for the way forward.
