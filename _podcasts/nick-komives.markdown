Today, I got a call from Nick Komives. Nick is the Executive Director at Equality Toledo. I believe Nick is one of Toledo's current great leaders and organizers. I love seeing his work and the passion behind what he does. That is, until his work leads him to respond to a terrible tragedy like the recent events in Orlando. Then, rather than look on with admiration and cheer, I join him in mourning with those who mourn. And I simply try to stand with him. Thankfully, for our community, when tragedy like a shooter in Orlando takes place, we have leaders like Nick ever committed to pushing forward the common good... for all people.
