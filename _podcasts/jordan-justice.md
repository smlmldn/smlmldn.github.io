Today I got a call from Jordan Justice. Jordan is a very close friend of mine and is also the Board President at The Toledo Bicycle Coalition where he works with all types of bike advocates throughout our city to make Toledo more bike friendly and ultimately create the type of city where he would like to raise his family. The TBC website says "The Toledo Bicycle Coalition inspires people to bicycle and advocates for a city where everyone feels comfortable riding." - Make sure to check it out and follow along with their work, ok?
