Today I got a call from Amelia Gibbon. There are so many ways to describe Amelia. And while she is one of the most kind and encouraging friends I have, I also believe she is one of the most thoughtful and wise leaders in our city. I first met Amelia when I was at Food for Thought and we immediately hit it off. I had found someone to listen to and learn from, and she was willing to pick up the phone when I called. From her post as the Executive Director at The Friendly Center she is consistently pulled in many different directions and asked to serve on countless boards and committees. (I always love to hear how she decides which commitment to take on.) This conversation could have taken a number of directions and still applied to the common good, because thatâ€™s what Amelia spends her time on. And we are a better city for it.
