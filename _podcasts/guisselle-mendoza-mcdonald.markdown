Today I got a call from Guisselle Mendoza McDonald. Guisselle is the Executive Director at Adelante, the Latino and community resource center in the old South end of Toledo. Guisselle is truly one of the rising leaders in our city and I was so excited to talk with her about her work at Adelante. Fresh off her visit to see Hillary in Toledo we talked about diversity not only within the city of Toledo, but also within the Latino community itself.
