Today I got a call from Sean Nestor. It's difficult to describe all that Sean does in our community. He is involved in so much, and in my calculation is one of the most community-minded people I know. The Phoenix Earth Food Co-Op, Lucas County Green Party, Toledoans for Safe Water... his finger prints are everywhere. And, yet, today's show wasn't about any of that. Instead, we talked about the new radio station he is involved with. WAKT FM will be on 106.1. Learn more here: [waktlp.org](http://waktlp.org)
