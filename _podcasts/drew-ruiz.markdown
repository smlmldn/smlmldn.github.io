Today I got a call from Drew Ruiz. Drew loves to create. And anytime we get a chance to talk I enjoy hearing his unique perspective on his craft and how that connects to other things he is passionate about. I really wanted to get his take on his latest creation, "Chef Ruiz on the Go." How does he connect his love for cooking and his love for cycling? What might that connection be able to teach us about our food system as a whole? It's always interesting conversation and I even learned a few new pieces of Drew's story in this episode as well.
