In this episode, I change it all up. 

I don't get a call. There isn't a ringtone. But, there is still a podcast. 

In this episode I give an update on what we are up to here with this podcast. And I lay out a few plans I have for the future of the podcast. 

My goal is pretty simple... I want to use this podcast to start conversations that spark ideas that lead to action that changes the current reality and propels the common good. That's my role. That's why I will sit down and talk to my phone, by myself. I want to use this medium to start those types of conversations. 

Thanks for listening. It means a lot. Have a great week!
