Julian is involved in so much of what is pushing forward the common good in our community. From his efforts with Black Lives Matter to the class he facilitated at Imagine Clay Avenue Community School this past year... I find his work inspiring. In this episode we discussed how Toledo history fuels his work and informs his LEAD program.
