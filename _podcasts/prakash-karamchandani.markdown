Today I got a call from... Prakash Karamchandani. Prakash (PK) is one of the most thoughtful, generous and innovative entrepreneurs in our city. Together with his business partner HoChan Jang (CJ), PK has created Balance Pan-Asian Grille. Anyone who has been to Balance knows why PK & CJ make such a great team. And I was really interested in this episode to hear about how they have created the Balance culture with such intentionality.

*New to the podcast this week! Make sure to listen all the way through to the end too. I am going to be sharing a few things from my work in the community at the end of each episode, as well as asking a question to think about or even offer a few thoughts on how today's topic connects to our city and how you can be involved. The common good is definitely a group project so I thought the podcast should reflect that.*
