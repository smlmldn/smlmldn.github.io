Today I got a call from Mike Ferner. Mike is a former City Councilman and mayoral candidate and is currently organizing a group called Advocates for a Clean Lake Erie. Nearly two years ago we experienced the "water crisis" of 2014 and this is the first of many episodes where I will talk to people involved in our water issues in Northwest Ohio. Why are there so many different perspectives and seemingly so little progress? Why are there so many different perspectives and seemingly so little progress? Is it a communication problem? Government inefficiency? Do we know the way forward? 

Also, be sure to listen all the way to the end. I have a few questions for you and would love to have you involved in a few projects I am attempting to organize. The common good is a group effort so we need to push it forward together.
