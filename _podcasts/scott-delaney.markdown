Today I got a call from Scott Delaney. Scott works with one of the most impressive urban agriculture programs in our region at The University Church in south Toledo. Through their expansive garden, after school program and other food programs, Scott is leading an incredible effort to reimagine the way a community relates to food. I'm slightly surprised we even got through this conversation without our normal level of sarcasm. But we did! I really appreciate Scott's faithfulness to his work and the compassionate way he handles every thing he does.
