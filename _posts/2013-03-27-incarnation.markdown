I don’t understand that. It doesn’t make sense to me. My daughter lives in a strange, small world of imaginary words & dancing like [Elaine Benes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xi4O1yi6b0). 

If I’m honest I thought I would be a much better father than I am. It’s hard. Even in the simple ways.

I mean, to come home from work and jump into whatever has been going on all day in Norah’s world and engage with her on her terms… is difficult for me. I just want to come home, sit down, watch Jon Stewart or Shark Tank episodes and have her cuddle with me on the couch. (She doesn’t quite like Mark Cuban the way I do though)

Something hit me recently… 

We are headed into Easter this weekend, its all about resurrection and new life, however I have been back pondering the very nature of incarnation… been thinking about God **with** us. Incarnation is all about our father in heaven coming down into our world, putting on flesh and dwelling among us. I could talk more about this… write a few more paragraphs, but I dont need to. 

Here’s what I want…. to be an “incarnational father.” To be the kind of Daddy who goes into Norah’s World, no matter the “sacrifice” or “discomfort.” Afterall… from everything people have told me (about a million times) it’s going to go by so fast.

So, for now, I think that image… God putting on flesh, to come & teach & guide & love & be **with** us & comfort & sacrifice for us… thats a good image for parenting.
