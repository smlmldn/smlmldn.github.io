## I'm not sure who's idea it was, but I think it was a mistake for Bernie & Co. to refer to their campaign as a revolution.
 
There is certainly a movement happening. “Not me, us” is a perfect contrast with Hillary’s opening message of being your “champion.” And, that continues to be true. Hillary’s value prop is experience, putting her at the center of the story, where Bernie rolls on as the reluctant revolutionary, riding huge waves of campaign contributions. However, there are two problems I think of when I hear “revolution” recently. 
 
First, while contextually brilliant, it is unintentionally apathy-inducing. In this context, people want a revolution where the billionaire class doesn’t buy up candidates and elections. However, and especially considering the context, people don’t actually think a revolution is possible. A movement? A wave? A new chapter? Hope? Change? Sure. A revolution? Not likely. People doubt Hillary because of distrust. She’s a Clinton with the most experience in a game they don’t want to play anymore. They doubt Bernie because they doubt someone can truly change the game with one revolutionary campaign. I actually believe, people fundamentally know you make change bit by bit and not all at once. 
 
Second, I’ve been thinking about two quotes recently. First, and I’m not sure who actually said this, “The revolution will not be televised, but it will be tweeted.” And then second, Shane Claiborne once said, speaking of living in community and changing the world in small, incremental ways, “Everyone wants a revolution, but no one wants to do the dishes.”
 
I think the word “movement” would have been better. It’s tough for a revolution to transfer energy, it seems to conquer the statue or dissolve. And, in politics, we need more movement. More transferable energy after primary period. Lets tweet the revolution, but get ready to do the dishes too. ## A New Post
