This storm is trying to push it out prematurely, but I hope fall sticks around a bit longer. I was just talking to a friend the other day about the seasons and it struck me that every season carries it’s own unique call.

I think the warning of fall is: *“Don’t waste a single moment, I’ll be gone before you know it.”*

Fall comes after the long, fruitful summer and creates the most majestically, fleeting beauty one can imagine.

Think about this… A leaf, having changed colors, lets go from a tree and flies through the sky. It will never attempt this jump again. It drops, and goes on to prepare life for something else. Its amazing… and if we blink we’ll miss it. Fall asks us not to miss it.

I need that message. I really should take this call seriously in every possible way. Every day I hold my 3 month old daughter is the last day I will hold her in that same way. My 2 year old, who I used to hold the same way, is so smart and sings so wonderfully.

I love that seasons tell us what to do.
