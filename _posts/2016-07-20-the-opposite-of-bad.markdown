The opposite of bad leadership isn’t anything other than good leadership. Let’s say that differently… The opposite of bad leadership... is good leadership. Nothing else gets you there. 

In a tough environment, only good leadership will do. Fear will try to coax you toward the safe play, telling you not to risk the chance of failure, don't show yourself to be incapable. The fear moments are the ones that matter the most. Those places and conversations and conflicts that every leader deals with where our chest gets tight and blood speeds up. And it is in **that** moment, that the opposite of bad leadership is not staying quiet so no one disagrees. In that moment, the opposite of the thing you are tempted toward, is **good** leadership. You can’t ignore your role, your call, or your task. You have to step up and do the next right thing. The fear is set aside and you take the right step forward. 

So often, it seems as if people are running businesses, parenting their children, interacting with donors and implementing public policy based on what they think will not be bad, rather than considering what is good.

Good is what matters. Good should be our goal. Striving for the opposite of bad won’t get you there.
